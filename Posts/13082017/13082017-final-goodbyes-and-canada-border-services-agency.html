        After many long months of hard work the day finally arrived when we were going to emigrate to Canada. It is hard to describe the amalgam of emotions we were feeling. A mixture of stress, excitement, sadness, happiness, closure and the start of something brand new. </p>

        Around 9 a.m., our families picked us up at our apartment in Antwerp. We left our first home were we shared several lovely moments both together and with friends knowing that it would be in good hands (my sister’s).

        After a drive to the airport (which seemed to take forever) we loaded all our belongings on two “small” airport carts and entered the entrance halls. Two people, their friends and family walking in a large Congo line towards the luggage check-in. A sight which must have been entertaining to see. A couple of minutes later all our belongings were processed and we were ready to say that dreadful “goodbye” to people we love. </p>

        After going through the usual conundrum at the airport, we cosied up somewhere near our gate and waited for our flight to Iceland which was delayed. We watched the “Emigration to Toronto – CA” countdown timer we created in May dwindle closer and closer to zero.

        Around 1 p.m. our flight finally arrived and we boarded our pink WOW air Plane. WOW air is throughly a low-fare, no-frills airline, no free water or coffee, no entertainment system but the seats are comfortable and we brought some food aboard the plane. 10/10 would recommend if you are as cheap as we are. </p>

        Two flights, one short stop in Iceland and some gorgeous views from Greenland later we finally touched down in Toronto. Stress levels quickly became almost unbearable as we needed to go through immigration services. In our last couple of weeks in Belgium, my grandparents made sure to tell me all the horror stories they saw on “Border Security: Canada’s front line”. Different kinds of worst case scenarios were going through my mind. In most of them I ended up in jail or was sent back to Belgium. In reality, the female officer from the Canada border services agency was all we could have hoped for. In fact, I think she was glad that for once she could have a conversation with applicants in English instead of needing a Chinese translator (almost all the other people in line were family reunions from China). I received entry as a visitor until February 2018 and Kyra received her study permit without any hassle. </p>

        After a brief search for all our suitcases, we took a cab downtown. Both of us extremely tired after a long and stressful day we finally saw a glimpse of our new city, Toronto and it did not disappoint. </p>
